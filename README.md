# Nested Selectors App

This is the GitHub repository for this project I made using **Angular** and **Bootstrap** as a *Nested Selectors App* example which uses the [REST Countries API] (https://restcountries.eu/) to make a http request for Regions, Coutries and Border Countries for the selected Country.

Right now **it's deployed here https://nested-selectors-tcp.netlify.app**
